	Dear Fellow Exeter Residents:
</p>
<p>
	On March 10th, please consider voting for Daryl Browne to fill one of the two open seats on the Town of Exeter's Select Board.
</p>
<p>
	Since 1979, New Hampshire has been my home. I was raised in Salem, then Derry, graduating from Pinkerton Academy in 1989. 
	After college, I followed several technology jobs around the United States - from Georgia to California - but came back to our beloved state in 2001. I taught computer science at Plymouth State University for 10 years and served on the Select Board there from 2008 to 2011. While in that position, I contributed local focus and clear-headed oversight on issues that ranged from union negotiations to public safety complex construction.
</p>
<p>
	My wife and I moved to Exeter in 2015, and our daughter was born here at Exeter Hospital in 2016. We have owned and operated a downtown business on Water Street since 2017, and I currently work as a programmer for a software startup based in Exeter. From running a business that helps make our historic downtown center a destination to helping push the envelope of our state's technology presence, I understand the benefits business brings as well as the responsibility it has to support our town's human and natural resources. 
</p>
<p>
	I believe in local government and in the importance of delegating and entrusting authority to committees that are accountable but not micromanaged. If elected, I will listen, learn and relay every town member's perspective to each issue the board oversees. 
</p>
<p>
	Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to serving you as a member of our Select Board for the next three years.
</p>
<p>
	Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
	Daryl Browne
